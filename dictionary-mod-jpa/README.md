## From https://github.com/rxue/dictionary/issues/172
`@Embedded` class is not supported to be in an abstract `@Entity` class. This kinda just obey the "composition over inheritance rule"

When using `quarkus-resteasy-jsonb` to make REST API endpoint, the attribute annotated with `@Embedded` inside a *JPA entity* will not be visible in the implemented REST API endpoint response JSON. This is a bit different from that when using `resteasy` of *WildFly* to implement the REST API. In order to make the `@Embedded` attribute visible in the response JSON, add *getter* and *setter* to that `@Embedded` field. Moreover, the `@Embedded` annotation is not compulsory, i.e. it can be removed

### Database schema is not initialized by Hibernate in IT tests by means of `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` but `@QuarkusTest`
### In Quarkus project generated by means of Quarkus project starter, the `skipITs` is set to `true` by default
### When running all the tests with `mvn clean verify`. As to those IT tests using `@QuarkusTests` to start database generate with Hibernate, database schema is initialized by Hibernate only once for all the IT test classes
